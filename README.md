# KUP-ESM-AD
Repository for the research group on Earth System Modeling: Atmospheric Dynamics of the Climate and Environmental Physics Institute of the University of Bern.

Here scripts for pre-processing, postprocessing and running the different climate models employed in the group can be shared.

The main goal  would be to make the scripts permanently available for future uses. All the uploaded codes must be properly commented and documented.
